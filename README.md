# Graph Assignment
Data Structure Course Assignment

(*Important Note: Some of the code for this project was provided for us by the professor to set up the assignment. This code is either authored by the professor or a given source in the comments*) This assignment had us take coordinate input from a "map.dat" file, find the shortest point between two locations, and give the directions and distance traveled to a "directions.dat" file. This assignment had us focus on our knowledge of Graphs and Arrays.
